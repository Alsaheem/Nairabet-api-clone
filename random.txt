This is where we put our random ideas

@ olumide....theres a library called Django-Cors-headers......this library is used if you want your api to communicate with a frontend like react or vue
  their repo is at  https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers






please note that interfields have limit of number they can hold, for insance, on this model below

class Mybet(models.Model):
    stake = models.IntegerField()
    total_return = models.IntegerField()

the field of total return could be millions, but models.interfield() cannot hold million,  but models.bigintergerfield() can





on the betcode generator model,

the bets field should be a foreign key field from Mybets model not the Bet model
